By the same token, to say X thinks that the lightning is pink means nothing other than X thinks the lightning is pink, or the lightning is pink, thinks X, which is not the same as, and, moreover, doesnt even begin to resemble the proposition the lightning is pink, but is, or is like, a somewhat more complicated phrase about the lightning, and about X.  And yet it was summer, it was evening, and the lightning was blue.",
