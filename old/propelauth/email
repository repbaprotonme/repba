Ah, so it looks like you aren't passing in an access token in the header. 

If you go here: https://auth.reportbase.com/api/v1/refresh_token you'll see some JSON and one of the fields is an access_token. Copy that in the curl command like this:

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer COPIED_TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:8787 

and it should work. In the frontend, you'll want to make sure you are also passing in an access token, but those are provided by our frontend libraries (e.g. withAuthInfo provides an access token if you are using React)

Both places it happens.   Here is the curl command.

Thanks, that all looks good. Are you getting the error when making a curl request or from the browser? In either case, could I see that code?

Hey Tom,

Can you show me how you are making the request to the worker?

Best,

I ran the cloudflare example and got the following result:

No authorization header found.

Any ideas?
